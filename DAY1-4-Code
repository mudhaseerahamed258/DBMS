ANSWER:

a) Create the CUSTOMERS table:

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    NAME VARCHAR(255),
    AGE INT,
    ADDRESS VARCHAR(255),
    SALARY DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

b)Insert 5 new records into the table:

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID, NAME, AGE, ADDRESS, SALARY)
VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 25, '123 Main St', 50000.00),
(2, 'Bob', 30, '456 Elm St', 60000.00),
(3, 'Charlie', 40, '789 Oak St', 70000.00),
(4, 'David', 55, '101 Pine St', 80000.00),
(5, 'Eve', 60, '202 Maple St', 90000.00);


c) Delete the record for customer name 'John':

DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE NAME = 'John';

d) Update customer salary for those whose age is greater than 50:

UPDATE CUSTOMERS SET SALARY = SALARY * 1.1 WHERE AGE > 50;


e) Select the column names from the table:

SELECT COLUMN_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'CUSTOMERS';

f) Sort the age in descending order:

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS ORDER BY AGE DESC;

g) Delete the table Customers from the database:

DROP TABLE CUSTOMERS;
